        <h4>This Is Khinkali, One of the most well-known food from Georgia</h4>
        <p>Khinkali is a traditional Georgian dumpling known for its juicy filling and unique shape. 
        Typically filled with spiced meat—usually a mix of beef and pork—it can also be made with mushrooms, 
        cheese, or potatoes. The dough is twisted at the top into a knot, forming a pleated pouch that holds flavorful broth inside.</p>

        <P>Eating khinkali has its own etiquette: they are traditionally eaten by hand,
         holding the top knot and taking small bites to sip the juice before finishing the rest.
         The knot is usually left uneaten. Khinkali is not only a staple of Georgian cuisine but also a cultural symbol, 
         often shared at family meals and festive gatherings.</P>
