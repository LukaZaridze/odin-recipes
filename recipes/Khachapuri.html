        <h4>This Is Khachapuri, One of the most well-known food from Georgia</h4>
        <p>Khachapuri is a beloved Georgian dish made of soft, freshly baked bread filled with melted cheese. 
        There are several regional variations, but the most famous is Adjarian khachapuri,
        shaped like a boat and topped with a raw egg and a pat of butter, 
        meant to be mixed in while the bread is still hot.</p>

        <p>It’s often enjoyed as a comfort food and shared among friends or family.
        Eaten by tearing off pieces of the crust and dipping them into the cheesy, 
        eggy center, khachapuri is both filling and flavorful.
        Its rich taste and cultural significance make it a must-try part of Georgian cuisine.</p>
